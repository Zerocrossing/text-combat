A simple text based interface for a combat engine for a game idea.

Combat is based around constructing sentences from combinations of words.
Currently only adjectives and verbs are implemented.

Run build_character.py to begin the character creation and enter a dummy arena.

Please note this is a very early demo of a concept. 
This code will never actually be used, little effort is made to sanitize inputs
It is an internal tool designed to help prototype and iterate the combat system.
